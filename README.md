Analytics statement:
  I have no interest in tracking you, finding out who you are, or selling you anything.
  I am only using them to:
  1. Discover which posts are popular so I can write more on what people find helpful and useful.
  2. Discover out which browser agents are accessing the site the most so I can make sure the site is optimised for those.
  3. Discover where referrals are coming from if any of my posts get shared around. It's nice to know you're popular.
